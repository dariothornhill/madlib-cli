# A simple madlib game to build experience with files and exceptions

- Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
- Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
- You need to decide what components of this file are useful, and how to break those useful pieces apart
- Once you know what parts of the template need user input, such as Adjective, prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
- With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
- After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
- Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo).
- Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.
